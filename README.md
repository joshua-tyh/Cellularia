# Cellularia

"Cellularia" is a one-word name that cleverly combines elements of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton, with the concept of development or progression. The name is formed by merging "cellular", referring to the game's grid of cells that evolve based on rules, with the suffix "-aria" denoting a collection or system.
